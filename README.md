# Authorizer Server on Heroku

Deploy production ready [authorizer.dev](https://authorizer.dev) instance using [heroku](https://heroku.com) with [PostgreSQL](https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer-heroku) and Redis and build with it in 30seconds

[![Deploy to Heroku](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/authorizerdev/authorizer-heroku)

After click the above button you will see screen as below, follow the steps mentioned below:

## Step 1: Enter the App name

App name becomes the url for your application. Example if you have entered `authorizer-demo` as the app name then the authorizer url will be `authorizer-demo.herokuapp.com`.

## Step 2: Choose the Region

Select the region you want to deploy you application in. Heroku supports United States and Europe only.

## Step 3: Configure Required Variables

Authorizer v2 requires the following variables. Configure them in Heroku's **Config Vars** section:

| Variable | Description | Example |
| -------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `DATABASE_TYPE` | Database type | `postgres` |
| `DATABASE_URL` | Database connection string | *(auto-configured by Heroku add-on)* |
| `JWT_TYPE` | JWT signing algorithm | `HS256` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | JWT signing secret | `test` |
| `ENCRYPTION_KEY` | At-rest key for TOTP secrets and OTP digests. Required with `RS*`/`ES*` | *(output of `openssl rand -hex 32`)* |
| `ADMIN_SECRET` | Admin secret for admin operations | `admin` |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Client identifier **(required)** | `123456` |
| `CLIENT_SECRET` | Client secret **(required)** | `secret` |

These are mapped to CLI flags at startup.

### Upgrading to 2.4.0

`ENABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION=true` with no SMTP configured is now a **fatal boot
error**, not a warning. Every account-recovery route ends at the same mailbox,
so without a mail path a user is created unverified and can never recover. If
you set it, also set `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT` and `SMTP_SENDER_EMAIL` — all
three — or the container will exit on start.

`APP_COOKIE_SAME_SITE` is now validated at boot too: an unrecognised value
exits rather than silently falling back to `lax`.

Two optional flags were added for the 2.4.0 security changes, both defaulting
to the secure behaviour:

- `OAUTH_ALLOW_UNVERIFIED_PROVIDER_EMAIL` — a social login whose provider did
  not attest the email address no longer reaches an existing account. Set
  `true` only as a temporary compatibility measure.
- `FGA_ALLOW_UNCONSTRAINED_AGENTS` — a delegated (agent-acting-for-user) check
  against an authorization model with no `type agent` now denies. Set `true`
  only while migrating a model.

`MICROSOFT_ALLOWED_TENANTS` restricts which Entra tenants may sign in when
`MICROSOFT_TENANT_ID` is a multi-tenant alias (`common`/`organizations`/
`consumers`).
 Please refer to the [server configuration docs](https://docs.authorizer.dev/core/server-config) for all available flags.
